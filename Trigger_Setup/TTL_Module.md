# ⚠️ Parallel Port Cable Warning

**Important:** The parallel port cable that comes with the BIOPAC STB Interface Box (Fig 1) has, in my experience, frequently failed to send signals. Across several studies in different labs, issues that were initially thought to be related to the trigger code were resolved simply by replacing the supplied BIOPAC cable with a standard parallel port cable.

> **Tip:** If you are using the trigger code provided in this repository and no signals appear in BIOPAC, try switching out the cable before troubleshooting the software.
