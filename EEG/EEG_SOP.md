## Essential Steps (Brief Overview)

1. Gather all materials in equipment list and prepare for session by filling syringe with gel and putting stickers on flat ECOG electrodes.  
2. Measure the widest part of the participant’s head and select electrode cap based on size - for signal quality it is very important to have a snug fit, so always choose the smallest possible size whilst maintaining participant comfort.

| **Cap size**     | **Cap colour**  | **Cap measurement** |
|:-----------------|:----------------|:--------------------|
| Small            | 🟨 Yellow        | 50 – 54 cm            |
| Small/Medium     | 🟥🟨 Red/Yellow  | 52 – 56 cm            |
| Medium           | 🟥 Red           | 54 – 58 cm            |
| Medium/Large     | 🟥🟦 Red/Blue    | 56 – 60 cm            |
| Extra large      | 🟦 Blue          | 58 – 62 cm            |

3. If rereferencing to the mastoids: Clean mastoids with alcohol wipe, put gel in flat electrode well, remove backing of electrode sticker and place electrodes on mastoids. Secure further with a strip of tape.  
4. Fit EEG cap to participant's head, ensuring central electrode (A1 for ABC system, CZ for 10-20 system), is halfway between the front and back of the head (nasion to inion), as well as from side-to-side. Make sure the cap is **FIRMLY** against the head.
7. Insert syringe into each electrode holder and insert gel systematically to around 3/4 full.  
8. Connect electrode bundles and any external EXG electrodes to AD box and turn on.  
9. Start signal quality check by selecting offsets tab on actiview. Ensure all channels are <+/-50mv, and not fluctuating. If high or unstable offsets, remove electrode, insert addition gel, check for wire tension, reinsert electrode and recheck offset.
10. Next, check signal waveforms. For any noisy channels follow the above steps (channels can be noisy in offsets and not waveform, or vice-versa. Do electrode adjustments for each, separately).
11. Conduct experiment, remove equipment in reverse order to setup, and handwash EEG equipment immediately following the session (electrodes - warm water only; cap - warm water and gentle detergent).

## Quick Guide: How to Get Clean Signals

CAPS: 
They need to fit tightly!!! Both in size but also in placement. Once the position of the cap has been established, grab either size of the cap (near the ears), and pull down firmly. Tell the participant that you are going to do this and make sure that you don't pull on any hairs in the process. 

INSERTING GEL: 
Move hair side-to-side with syringe, then ever so slightly lift away from the scalp before inserting gel in a smooth gradual process whilst pulling the syringe out of the electrode holder.  

EXTERNAL ELECTRODES: 
Use extra tape for securing any/all EXG flat electrodes.

CHECKING CHANNEL QUALITY: 
Before starting the experiment, ensure all channels are clean and stable. Firstly, check the offsets tab, aiming for around <+/-50mv, (not 10, this value is often incorrectly referenced and stems from EEG systems using impedance. This is not equivalent to offsets, which, according to the manufacturers, can produce clean recordings up to +/-100mv). 

WIRE PLACEMENT: Try and put as little strain and stretch on the electrodes as possible. This includes, taping EXG electrode wires to participant's shoulders, taping electrode bundles to a desk or chair, and orentating electrode wires to 'flow' towards the AD box.

GLOBAL NOISE
If all channels look strange, the first thing to check is the CMS/DRL electrodes! These are critical for the entire recording.

# Extended Instructions

## 1. Before the Participant Arrives

### Participant Preparation
- It is best to ensure that the participant comes to the experiment without makeup, hair gel, mousse, or hair product in their hair.

### Prepare the Gel Syringes
1. Fill syringes with gel (Fig x.).  

  <p align="center">
    <img src="../images/EEG_Fig_Syringes.png" alt="Filled Syringes" width="35%">
    <br>
    <em>Figure X. Filled Syringes.</em>
  </p>
  
> **Helpful Tips**  
> <details>
> <summary>Click to expand</summary>
>   
> - Whenever possible, use 412 syringes.  
> -  To prevent air bubbles from entering the syringe, make sure the electrode gel has settled completely at the bottom of its tube before transferring it. If you notice air pockets in the gel tube, tap it firmly on a hard surface or shake it to release the trapped air before filling the syringe.
> - Do not fill syringes completely to the top; otherwise, the gel will overflow when you insert the plunger.  
> - Make sure to clean gel off the tip of the tube before and after filling the syringes to prevent them from getting blocked.  
> </details>

### Check Equipment
- Make sure all electrodes are ordered and untangled.  
- Make sure measuring tape and adhesive tape are within reach.  
- Make sure the head cap you need is dry.  
- You can speed-dry it with the hair dryer, but **only use cold air** so as not to damage the cap.

### Prepare Electrodes
- Prepopulate the electrodes with adhesive rings.  
- Make sure that the hole of the sticker aligns with the metal part of the electrode.

## 2. Upon Participant Arrival

### Participant Briefing and Consent
- Explain the procedure to the participant.  
- Give the participant plenty of time to read the information sheet and sign the consent form.  
- Ask participants to remove hairbands, bobby pins, glasses, and any other facial or ear jewellery before beginning the experiment. Glasses can be put on again after capping.

## Cap Fitting and Electrode Setup

#### Determine Cap Size
- Measure the participant’s head:  
  - **Circumference:** Place the tape just above the ears. 
  - **Length:** Beginning at the nasion and ending at the inion.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../images/EEG_Fig_Measurement.png" alt="Measuring head circumference and length" width="35%">

> <summary>Click to expand</summary>
> 
> - Always choose the smallest cap you can based on their head size. (For example, if the participant’s head circumference is x cm → use head cap x–x cm).  
> </details>

#### Prepare Mastoid Electrode Sites
- Wipe behind the participant’s ears with an alcohol wipe.  
- Dry off with a paper towel.

> <details>
> <summary>Click to expand</summary>
> 
> - If your participant is wearing makeup, take extra care to ensure it is completely removed from the mastoid electrode placement site before proceeding. This is an important reference point for the EEG setup, so you want to make sure the electrode stays securely in place 
> </details>


#### Place Mastoid Electrodes
- Place electrode on mastoid site by lining it up with the preauricular point and mastoid process.

> 
> - Begin the gelling process systematically (e.g., in strips or rows).  
>
> - Make sure you get close in behind the ear.  
> - Secure the electrode with extra tape.  
> - Make sure you don't stick participant’s hair down.  
> </details>

#### Fit the EEG Cap
- Ask the participant to look up toward the ceiling and place the cap on their head.  
- Hold the ear flaps and pull cap down, wiggling slightly side to side.  
- Make sure you pull the cap down to really get it tight.  
- Ask the participant to do up the chin strap while you hold the mastoids still.  
- Then get the participant to pull their ears through.

#### Center and Align the Cap
- Make sure the cap is properly centered. 
- Use a measuring tape to ensure that the Cz (Vertex) is in the center of the head:  
  - Halfway between the nasion and inion  
  - Halfway between the ears

### Begin Gelling Electrodes
1. Carefully push the blunt needle through the electrode aperture until it reaches the participant’s scalp.  
2. Gently move some hair to the side by pushing the tip of the needle side to side.  
3. Lift the syringe slightly (otherwise the blunted needle will be covered by the skin and no gel can come out).  
4. Use the nozzle to apply a small amount of gel.  
5. Spread the gel with a circular motion of the needle on the scalp, but do not overdo it. Too much gel can create “bridges” between electrodes.  
6. Slowly retract the needle, injecting enough gel to fill any air pockets left by the needle.

### Attach Electrodes
- The electrodes are numbered. Insert them in ascending order to avoid tangling.  
- Click electrodes into aperture; if resistance is felt, add more gel.  

**Helpful Tips**  
> <details>
> <summary>Click to expand</summary>
> 
> - Handle electrodes with care; they are delicate.  
> - Drape electrode wires over your shoulder to avoid dragging on the floor.  
> - Ensure electrodes aren’t clicked in at an angle. 
> - Make sure tails point in the direction you want wires to lie. 
> - Each electrode has a tail; orient it so the wires run neatly down the back of the participant’s neck.  
> - Leave the C-line electrodes until last as they’re most awkward to set up.
> - For transport: ask the participant to hold remaining leads in one hand to prevent trailing while walking.
